// ============================================================================
// Pashu Arogya Academy — Content data
// Written for the entire ground force — field staff with NO prior animal or
// veterinary background at all. Nothing is assumed: every single term is
// explained in plain words the moment it is first used, with everyday
// comparisons wherever they help. Content is adapted from NDDB's "Handbook
// of Good Dairy Husbandry Practices" and "Ethnoveterinary Formulations for
// Important Ailments in Bovines".
//
// A ground-force learner's job is to NOTICE and REPORT — not to diagnose or
// treat. That framing is repeated deliberately throughout Module 1 so it's
// never confused with a course that trains someone to practise veterinary
// medicine.
//
// Every learner-facing string is written with the L() helper:
//   L("English", "Telugu", "Tamil", "Kannada")
// so the whole app can render in the language the learner picked. English
// is always the fallback if a translation is thin.
//
// IMPORTANT — Module 1's veterinary content (vital-sign ranges, BCS
// interpretation, etc.) is shipped in English only: the te/ta/kn slots
// below intentionally repeat the English text. This is medical/treatment
// content — a sloppy translation of a number could lead to a real animal
// being mistreated, so get it reviewed by a qualified vet/para-vet fluent
// in the target language before publishing a real translation. See
// README.md.
