// ============================================================================
// Pashu Arogya Academy — Content data
// Written for the entire ground force — field staff with NO prior animal or
// veterinary background at all. Nothing is assumed: every single term is
// explained in plain words the moment it is first used, with everyday
// comparisons wherever they help. Content is adapted from NDDB's "Handbook
// of Good Dairy Husbandry Practices" and "Ethnoveterinary Formulations for
// Important Ailments in Bovines".
//
// A ground-force learner's job is to NOTICE and REPORT — not to diagnose or
// treat. That framing is repeated deliberately throughout Module 1 so it's
// never confused with a course that trains someone to practise veterinary
// medicine.
//
// Every learner-facing string is written with the L() helper:
//   L("English", "Telugu", "Tamil", "Kannada", "Hindi")
// so the whole app can render in the language the learner picked. English
// is always the fallback if a translation is thin.
//
// IMPORTANT — all non-English text in this file (including Module 1's
// veterinary content: vital-sign ranges, BCS interpretation, dosages,
// vaccination schedules, treatment steps) is machine-translated. This is
// medical/treatment content — a sloppy translation of a number or dosage
// could lead to a real animal being mistreated. The app shows learners a
// "pending vet review" notice on non-English languages for exactly this
// reason. Get every non-English technical passage reviewed by a qualified
// vet/para-vet fluent in the target language before treating it as
// authoritative. See README.md.
